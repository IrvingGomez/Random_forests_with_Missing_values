# Random Forests for Regression with Missing Entries
These are the source codes used in the articles:

* On the Consistency of a Random Forest Algorithm in the Presence of Missing Entries, Irving Gómez-Méndez and Emilien Joly, 2021 (to be published).
* Regression with Missing Data, a Comparison Study of Techniques Based on Random Forests, Irving Gómez-Méndez and Emilien Joly, 2021 (to be published).

More specific codes for the creation of the datasets with missing values, the construction of the random forests for each missing-data mechanism, etc. can be found in https://github.com/IrvingGomez/RandomForestsSimulations.

There, it is possible to find examples on its use, in particular the example <a href="https://github.com/IrvingGomez/Random_forests_with_missing_values/blob/main/examples/Example_Anderson%20iris.ipynb">Example_Anderson iris.ipynb</a> shows most of the features.
