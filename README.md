# Random Forests for Regression with Missing Entries
These are the source codes used in the articles:

* On the Consistency of a Random Forest Algorithm in the Presence of Missing Entries, Irving Gómez-Méndez and Emilien Joly, 2021 (to be published).
* Regression with Missing Data, a Comparison Study of Techniques Based on Random Forests, Irving Gómez-Méndez and Emilien Joly, 2021 (to be published).

More specific codes for the creation of the datasets with missing values, the construction of the random forests for each missingness mechanism can be found in https://github.com/IrvingGomez/RandomForestsSimulations.
